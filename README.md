# YouTube Dash DL

Just another barely functional tool do download YouTube livestreams.

## How to use

### Install (pip)

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Currently very fragile, yet intuitive and (hopefully) working correctly.

### How to use

1. Enter desired live stream URL with only the base id (without playlist junk at the end).
2. Let the program check available bitrates and resolutions
3. Type in output file name, and adjust the time of wanted time frame of live stream
4. Output video format selection not working yet (keep in .mp4).
4. Click check and hope for the best!
