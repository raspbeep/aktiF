# aktiF

Just another barely functional tool to download YouTube livestreams.

### Download
```shell
git clone https://github.com/raspbeep/aktiF.git
```

### Install requirements(pip)

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to use
Currently, very fragile yet intuitive and (hopefully) working correctly.

1. Enter desired live stream URL with only the base id (without playlist junk at the end).
2. Let the program check available bit rates and resolutions
3. Type in output file name, and adjust desired time frame
4. Output video format selection not working yet (keep in .mp4).
4. Click Download and hope for the best! (High-res or long video might take a while)


#### Python compatibility

-   3.6+
